        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">üìä What is Apop Mining?</h2>
        <p>
          Apop Mining is a lean, solar-powered mining operation optimized for efficient cryptocurrency generation.
          It runs a dedicated fleet of both GPU and ASIC miners and is built to operate fully autonomously ‚Äî requiring little to no manual oversight for long periods of time.

        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Custom-built mining frames and PSU layout</li>
          <li>Automated scheduling system that only runs during solar hours</li>
          <li>Robust HVAC configuration designed for optimal airflow and passive thermal regulation</li>
          <li>Velcro-mounted controller units for modular access and servicing</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-2">‚ö° Energy Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          The operation is fully powered by solar energy during the day. A custom program, that I wrote, monitors real-time sun exposure and
          only activates mining processes when adequate energy is available ‚Äî eliminating wasted runtime and reducing thermal load.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-2">üöÄ Long-Term Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Apop Mining is designed to scale efficiently and multiply investor capital over time. With clean energy integration,
          a programmatic control system, ASIC and GPU compatibility, and minimal maintenance needs, it's a self-sustaining platform
          focused on long-term profitability with maximum autonomy.
